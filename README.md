_Userscripts, reloaded._


Remoded was originaly conceived sometime before Christmas 2011, but it
never really got beyond the idea stage. A little later, I had a look at
[dotjs][0], bringing in a refreshing thought of simplicity over the initially
complex thing I had in mind. Months passed, and finally I believe the
gestation period is over. **Remoded** is yearning to be born.


## Userscripts are tricky beasts

I [recently wrote a bit about Userscripts][1] and my impression of the
community behind them, at least while I was coding a lot in there. I
complained about the apparent animosity expressed towards &laquo; noobs
&raquo; who wanted to use jQuery instead of just pure DOM and Javascript.

Userscripts are somewhere between apps and websites and bookmarklets.
They have **context**, as in, they run on the web, on top of something
that exists; they can be **distributed**, made by developers and used by
people\*; they are **varied**... from minor tweaks to completely new UIs.
When remaking them, then, one needs to consider all of these. It's not easy.

\* _Not that developers aren't people. Although that's debatable._


## One file userscripts are sooo 2010

I mean, does anyone on the web does any serious work all in one file? OK, there's
a few, but generally development is done with a variety of files. You might be
used to concatenating everything in one file for production, but the reason for
_that_ is about network latency &mdash; a problem that isn't one if all your
files are local. Plus, requiring that all code be in one file means you can't
use frameworks like [jQuery UI][2] or [Pinot][3], nor many different libraries
or plugins, nor images, nor flash if that's your fancy, nor...


## Remoded brings freedom to this twisted plane

A Remoded userscript takes the shape of a single directory in `~/.remoded`. The
naming goes like this:

```
scriptname@example.com/         # This will be loaded on example.com/*
scriptname@foo.example.com/     # This will be loaded on foo.example.com/*
scriptname@.example.com/        # This will be loaded on *.example.com/*
scriptname@global/              # This will be loaded everywhere
```

The part with the `@` is necessary so multiple userscripts can run on the same
domain, and be managed separately. You can get rid of it if you're just playing
around, but I don't recommend it.

Of course, the userscript isn't run based on the single matching of a domain...
that's were the Manifest comes in. In the userscript directory, the only required
file is a `Manifest`. This file offers all the flexibility you want with zero
effort. In its simplest form, it goes like this:

```
load script.js
```

All this does is load the file `script.js` into all matching pages (based on the
dir name). You can load as many files as you want, in the order you specify:

```
load lib/jquery.js
load lib/underscore.js
load lib/underscore.string.js
load script.js
```

But what if we only want to run on a subset of pages?

```
match foo
match \.php$
match ^bar/?.*(?!\.s?html?)$

# Also, domains, if you can run on several:
domain example\.com$
domain ^(b|a|z)\.example.+$

# Ports are thrown in for free
port 8080
port 4567
port ^[1-9]+000$
```

What about conditional loading? Well, there's better: scopes.

```
scope {
  match ^only/these/pages
  domain on\.this\.website
  
  load special.js
}
```

More coming... stay tuned!
