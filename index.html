        <p>Remoded was originally conceived sometime before Winter 2011, but it
never really got beyond the idea stage. A little later, I had a look at
<a href="http://defunkt.io/dotjs/">dotjs</a>, bringing in a refreshing thought of simplicity over the initially
complex thing I had in mind. Months passed, and finally I believe the
gestation period is over. <strong>Remoded</strong> is yearning to be born.</p>

<h2>Userscripts are tricky beasts</h2>

<p>I <a href="http://checkthis.com/71v0">recently wrote a bit about Userscripts</a> and my impression of the
community behind them, at least while I was coding a lot in there. I
complained about the apparent animosity expressed towards « noobs
» who wanted to use jQuery instead of just pure DOM and Javascript.</p>

<p>Userscripts are somewhere between apps and websites and bookmarklets.
They have <strong>context</strong>, as in, they run on the web, on top of something
that exists; they can be <strong>distributed</strong>, made by developers and used by
people*; they are <strong>varied</strong>... from minor tweaks to completely new UIs.
When remaking them, then, one needs to consider all of these. It's not easy.</p>

<p>* <em>Not that developers aren't people. Although that's debatable.</em></p>

<h2>One file userscripts are sooo 2010</h2>

<p>I mean, does anyone on the web does any serious work all in one file? OK, there's
a few, but generally development is done with a variety of files. You might be
used to concatenating everything in one file for production, but the reason for
<em>that</em> is about network latency — a problem that isn't one if all your
files are local. Plus, requiring that all code be in one file means you can't
use frameworks like <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ibdknox/pinot">Pinot</a>, nor many different libraries
or plugins, nor images, nor flash if that's your fancy, nor...</p>

<h2>Remoded brings freedom to this twisted plane</h2>

<p>A Remoded userscript takes the shape of a single directory in <code>~/.remoded</code>. The
naming goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>examplescriptname    # That's just a generic thing
example@author       # The code was pulled from @author's GitHub 'example' repo
gist-12345@author    # The code was pulled from @author's Gist 12345

# Currently, the last two are just a convention, but later on... :) 
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the userscript isn't run all the time, on every webpage... that's were
the Manifest comes in. In the userscript directory, the only required file is a
<code>Manifest</code>. This file offers all the flexibility you want with zero effort. In its
simplest form, it goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>load "script.js"
</code></pre>

<p>All this does is load the file <code>script.js</code> into all pages. You can load as many
files as you want, in the order you specify:</p>

<pre><code>load "lib/jquery.js", "lib/underscore.js"
load [
  "lib/underscore.string.js"
  "script.js"
]
</code></pre>

<p>But what if we only want to run on a subset of pages?</p>

<pre><code>match "foo/bar"                 # Exact matching (+/- trailing slash)
match "*.php"                   # Wildcard matching (Not implemented)
match /^bar\/?.*(?!\.s?html?)$/ # Regexp

# Also, domains:
domain "example.com"
domain /^(b|a|z)\.example.+$/

# Ports are thrown in for free
port 8080, 4567
port "1200..1234"   # Ranges! (Not implemented)
port /^[1-9]+000$/
</code></pre>

<p>What about conditional loading? Well, there's better: scopes.</p>

<pre><code>scope -&gt;
  match "only/this/page"
  domain "on.this.websi.te"

  load "special.js"
</code></pre>

<p>The Manifest is actually a CoffeeScript DSL, so you can use functions,
variables, and the full power of the language to achieve exactly what
you want.</p>
